# recreating-8-ball-pool
A university project where I had to recreate a game (in this case, 8 ball pool) in engine, including physics.

I recreated 8 ball pool as a two player 2D game in Unity. I included turn based mechanics using a state machine and used 2D physics for motion when the balls move.

I created all the artwork for this game myself using Aseprite.
